# ml-web-app
I used Flask, Bootstrap and Sci-Kit learn to build and deploy a full stack web application onto the internet.

Components of the application:


Server Side: Carried out using Flask

ML Operations: Done using Sci-Kit Learn 

Frontend: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also used Bootstrap to clean up the UI
